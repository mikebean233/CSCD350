    This repository is intended to be a place where we can collaberate on group 
assignments / projects.  I suggest making a new branch for every contribution you
make to a team assignment, then either merging your branch with the master
branch, or create a pull request for it.  As you're working on something that 
will integrate with other peoples work, it's a good idea to stay caught up with
other peoples changes by merging their code into yours at the beginning of each
session..
